# Supernovas-In-Space
Deep Learning for detecting Supernovas in Space

Astronomers have developed telescopes and satellites in order to study the dark energy in space by capturing the intense gravitational forces in space, some of which are caused by Supernovas. We explore various models based on CNN architecture to identify point-source transients and moving objects in space. Some of these images contain supernovas. We developed classification models to identify images containing supernovae using CNN-based architectures.
